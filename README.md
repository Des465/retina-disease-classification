# Retina disease classification using Efficient Net B3.
Retina diseases are a significant problem, especially amongst elderlies, that result in headaches, vision loss or even blindness. This project utilizes computer vision and best practices to achieve a high scores in classification task, assisting in rapid illness categorization.

It addresses class imbalance through stratified splits and data augmentation techniques like Gaussian blur, achieving evaluation metrics including F1 score and ROC-AUC. Built with PyTorch Lightning and Albumentations for efficient training on GPU-accelerated environments.
